Data Structures
	
	For this assignment we would mainly be focusing on using lists, tables
	and dynamic arrays

Void*
	
	The void pointers are going to need to be changed so that they are no 
	longer void and are now characters, char. This way, when we are going 
	through the list of the names and finger prints, we can be able to 
	return where each one would belong much easier

Invariant

	The invariant in this assignment is going to be all of the name and
	finger prints that we had already checked. Similar to the example 
	given about how the invariant of insertion sort would be the numbers
	to the left of the pointer, which have already been checked, the names
	and their respective finger prints have already been checked as well.
	
Answer 

	To solve this assignment, I believe that we are going to need to go 
	through a list and then at each instance we should then separate each	
	input into a different table that will then correspond to their respective
	finger prints
