Kevin Croker and I worked on this assignment together. 

We received most of the help from our assignments from the book recommended and the examples that Professor Daniels showed in class. We also spoke to our other classmates to try and get ideas on parts where we got stuck. We asked for different perspectives to see if maybe we were looking at problems the wrong way which would have been the cause of us getting stuck while planning out and coding. 

Despite our best efforts using all the resources that were available to us, we were unable to correctly implement any of the functions. We are not sure what exactly it is that we did wrong but we look to use this as a teaching experience and next time to try more diligently to solve the problems presented to us.

Kevin and I spent about 15 hours together working on this assignment. I do believe that with a little more hard work, and a little more time spent on the assignment we could have gotten more parts of the assignment working.
