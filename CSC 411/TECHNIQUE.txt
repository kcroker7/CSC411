TECHINIQUE

We were not able to use our technique for this project because we could only work on it 
together a few times. However, our technique is to have one person write code for 10-15
minutes while the other is checking for any mistakes as the person types. It is much 
easier to catch mistakes when you are simply reading rather than thinking of what to 
type next for your code to work and compile. After this time is up, we are going to 
switch positions so we don't just have one person typing the code the entire time. It 
is a very useful way to understand what the other person's train of thought is on this
assignment and future assignments as well. We are hoping that we will be able to 
implement this technique on other assignments when we are able to have time to meet up.
